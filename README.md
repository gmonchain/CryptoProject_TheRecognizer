## Revolutionizing Community Recognition on Farcaster with Arbitrum

![FarRank Banner](Banner/Banner.png)

### The Problem: Unseen Contributions in Decentralized Communities

Farcaster communities thrive on valuable contributions, yet effectively identifying and rewarding their most impactful members remains a significant challenge. Traditional social media metrics often fall short, failing to capture the true depth of a member's influence. This leaves many valuable contributors unrecognized and under-incentivized, hindering organic community growth and engagement.
